mongooose helps us in reducing code
because it has easy feature to check the data before storing in the backend

if we manually wants to check , we sill use if else block for every api call

but mongooose doesn't need all those
it just need required, minlength, maxlength

We use insert one method, insertmany method or sasve method to store the data in database

at the time of insertion and updating, validation is required
but at the time of reading, validation is not required


we need to provide the default error handler middleware

how it handles?
express will ivoke the error handler middleware when express sense an error
